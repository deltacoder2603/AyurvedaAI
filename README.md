## üìÑ Usage Examples

### Asking About Symptoms
```
User: "I've been having frequent headaches, especially in the afternoon"

Ayurveda AI: "From an Ayurvedic perspective, your afternoon headaches may indicate a Pitta imbalance. 
Consider cooling herbs like Brahmi or Amalaki. Try drinking coconut water and reducing exposure 
to direct sunlight. A cooling oil like sandalwood applied to the forehead may also help."
```

### Exploring Herbal Remedies
```
User: "What are Ayurvedic approaches to managing joint pain?"

Ayurveda AI: "Ayurveda views joint pain (Sandhigata Vata) as primarily a Vata disorder. 
Beneficial herbs include Ashwagandha, Guggulu, and Shallaki. Warm oil massages with 
sesame or castor oil can help. Consider adding turmeric and ginger to your diet, 
and practice gentle yoga to improve joint mobility."
```
